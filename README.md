A complete code for a Discord bot to do contests. Easy to modify and free !

This code is open source, you can modify it in your own way. If you want to, consider leaving the link to this Github project in a place on the bot to show that you respect the work of others.

## üìö - Presentation

This template is here to help you build a bot that will make Giveaways.
This code is complete and has several functions such as :

- The bot saves the giveaways so they won't be deleted if the bot needs to restart.
- The bot can change language.
- The bot can be configured (lounge logs, special role to manage launch a giveaway if the member does not have permission to manage messages...).

And lots of other features to discover !

## ‚öôÔ∏è - Configuration

First of all you will need Node, you can download it by just clicking [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The most recent version is recommended.

First of all, let's indicate our access path, in the command prompt :

```
cd (the access link of your bot's folder, example var/www/mybot)
```

We are going to use several modules, to install them do this in your command prompt :

```
npm i
```

All the module names are in "package.json" and "package-lock.json" all the files are useful don't forget to delete them.

**change .env.example into .env and fill your bot token first**


Then we'll fill in everything the bot will need to ensure proper operation.
Open the file "bot.js" which is located in the "config" folder.



Fill it out as below :

```js
module.exports = {

    token: "",

    idbot: "",

    prefix: "",

    basiclang: "",

    embeds: {
        color: "",
        footers: ""
    },

    start: {
        loading: "",
        activity: "",
    },

    events: {
        addcolor: "",
        remcolor: ""
    },

    reaction: "",

    grole: "",

    auth: {
        support: "",
        dperms: ""
    },
};
```

Don't panic everything is indicated in the file for what you need to fill out.
However, i remind you of all the functions below :

- `idbot`, the ID of your robot.
- `prefix`, the prefix of your robot.
- `basiclang`, the basic language of the bot "en" for English.
- `color`, embed color (in English).
- `footers`, embed footer.
- `loading`, loading status.
- `activity`, bot status.
- `addcolor`, the color of the event add (in English).
- `remcolor`, the color of the event remove (in English).
- `reaction`, reaction to the giveaways if you in the console you see "unknown emoji" that's what this emoji is not recognized by Discord.
- `grole`, if the member doesn't have permission to handle messages he can still use the giveaways commands if he has the role configured right here.
- `support`, the link of your Discord server.
- `dperms`, the permissions that the bot asks on we want to add it on a Discord server (8 = moderator).

## üöÄ - Start the bot

```
#With Node
node index.js

#With pm2
pm2 start index.js
```

Note for pm2 : 

```
pm2 start = start bot
pm2 stop = stop bot
pm2 restart = restart bot
```

With Node you just have to redo (node index.js).

If in the console you see `Ready on [...] servers, for a total of [...] users.` The bot is ready !
If you see an error in the console, don't hesitate to fix it or to let me know.

## üîí - Storage part

Remember not to delete "json.sqlite" as it contains all current / cancelled / modified giveaways.

Thank you for using this code !
